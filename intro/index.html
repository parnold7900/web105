        <h1>Phil's Intro</h1>
        <p>I have always been fascinated by technology. 
        I am taking this course to gain a basic understanding in web development. 
        I am also taking programming, network security, and database management courses. 
        My goal is to see what area I enjoy most.</p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Military</h3>
            <img src="images/eagle.jpg" alt="American Eagle">
            <p>I was in the United States Army from 2008 until I was honorably discharged in 2015. 
            I served as a Stryker Systems Maintainer and a Recovery Operator. 
            I deployed to Iraq in 2010. I reached the rank of Sergeant during my time in the military.</p>
        <h3>Family</h3>
            <img src="images/wisconsin.jpg" alt="Wisconsin Forest">
            <p>I have a six year old son. One of our favorite things to do together is to take trips to 
            northern Wisconsin. While there we enjoy fishing, hiking, and bonfires. We are
             both currently in school. Our favorite sport is baseball</p>
        <h3>Extended Family</h3>
            <p>My immediate family is large, but my extended family is even larger. 
            Both of my parents are 1 of 6. I have over 75 cousins. 
            We have many family gatherings each year. An average family gathering 
            consists of nearly 100 people.</p>
